SyncVR Unity Sound Designer Assessment
Design Rationale

GENERAL WORKFLOW
 I started with the ambient sounds to create a kind of atmosphere. This helps setting the stage for further sound-design. For all the created audio and sounds I used a mixture of audio-samples (freesound.org, soundsnap.com) that I processed with eq, time-stretching, phaser effects, doublers and combined it with the use of synthesizers. All sounds are multi-layered. Throughout the process I kept a couple of things in mind:  

1. The patient needs to be distracted.
2. The sounds can’t be too creepy.
3. Due to the time-constraints It’s best to keep the style near Realism.

I created the sounds in this order: 

1. Ambience Forest Day + Ruins
2. Added extra local ambient sounds for tree trunks, leaves and mystical fires in Ruins.
3. Created different footsteps.
    Softlanding, Hardlanding, Jump.
4. UI (But can’t find a way to implement it. Sound is in the Library though) 
5. My time ran out. Total work duration (~5h)
